motion2.ino - uses DMP

// I2C device class (I2Cdev) demonstration Arduino sketch for MPU6050 class using DMP (MotionApps v2.0)
// 6/21/2012 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib


motion3 - does not use t_3 (i thinks standard i2c wire library)

 license: Beerware - Use this code however you'd like. If you 
 find it useful you can buy me a beer some time.
 
 Demonstrate  MPU-6050 basic functionality including initialization, accelerometer trimming, sleep mode functionality as well as
 parameterizing the register addresses. Added display functions to allow display to on breadboard monitor. 
 No DMP use. We just want to get out the accelerations, temperature, and gyro readings.



 problems with current sketch:
 	- cannot calibrate when started vertically?
 	- same side values on both sides of 0 (no positive to negative change)
